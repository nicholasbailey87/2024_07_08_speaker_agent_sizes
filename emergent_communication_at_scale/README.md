# Emergent communication at scale

This repo allows exploring different dynamics and RL algorithms
to train a population of agents that communicate to solve a referential game.
It is based on the [Jax](https://github.com/google/jax)/[Haiku](https://github.com/deepmind/dm-haiku)
python api, and the [Jaxline](https://github.com/deepmind/jaxline) training framework,
smoothly allowing for large-scale and multi-device experiments.
The repo contains the code which we used for the experiments reported in our
[ICLR 2022 paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=AUGBfDIV9rL), titled "Emergent Communication At Scale".

## Downloading dataset
Download the datasets [CelebA logits](https://storage.googleapis.com/dm_emcom_at_scale_dataset/byol_celeb_a2.tar.gz)
and [ImageNet logits](https://storage.googleapis.com/dm_emcom_at_scale_dataset/byol_imagenet2012.tar.gz) in the `emcom_datasets/` directory.

## Installation
Install dependencies by running the following commands:

```shell
# Create a virtual env
python3 -m venv ~/.venv/emcom
# Switch to the virtual env
source ~/.venv/emcom/bin/activate
# Install other dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Manually install the latest Jaxline version, since required 0.0.6 is not yet on pypi.
pip install git+https://github.com/deepmind/jaxline
```

### Lewis game
To run the Lewis game experiment
The Lewis game experiment trains a population of agents and
computes different metrics on the test set. To execute the Lewis game
experiment, run (from the `root` directory):

```shell
$ python -m emergent_communication_at_scale.main --config=emergent_communication_at_scale/configs/lewis_config.py
```

The ease of learning experiment assesses how easy and fast an
emergent language is transmitted to new listeners.
See our [paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=AUGBfDIV9rL) for more details
about this metric.
To run the ease of learning experiment,
*given a previous checkpoint saved by the Lewis experiment*, you can use this command:

```shell
$ python -m emergent_communication_at_scale.main --config=emergent_communication_at_scale/configs/ease_of_learning_config.py
```
