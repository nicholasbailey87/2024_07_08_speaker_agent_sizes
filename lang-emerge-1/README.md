This repository contains code to **train**, **evaluate**, and **visualize**
dialogs between conversational agents (Abot and QBot) that talk about
instances in an abstract world.

## Setup

All our code is implemented in [PyTorch][2]. Current version has been tested in Python 3.6 and PyTorch 1.4.

Additionally, our code also uses some famous python packages that can be installed as follows:

```
pip install json
pip install tqdm
pip install pickle
pip install json
```

## Contents

* `options.py` - Read the options from the commandline
* `dataloader.py` - Create and handle data for toy instances
* `chatbots.py` - Conversational agents - Abot and Qbot
* `learnChart.py` - Obtain evolution of language chart from checkpoints
* `html.py` - Easy creation of html tables
* `utilities.py` -  Helper functions
* `train.py` - Script to train conversational agents
* `test.py` - Script to test agents

## Usage
Checkout `run_me.sh` to see how train our model.

Pretrained models and detailed documentation coming soon!
