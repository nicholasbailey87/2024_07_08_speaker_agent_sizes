# Approximate speaker agent sizes used in emergent language research

Run the code in agent_sizes.ipynb to generate a CSV of approximate speaker agent sizes used in emergent language research.

We call these approximate because, although we attempted to initialise an agent model from the code provided with each study, our understanding of the code of each study is imperfect and we may have made some mistakes along the way.

For some studies, we tried our best to create a similar Pytorch model based on the description of the speaker agent given in the relevant paper.
